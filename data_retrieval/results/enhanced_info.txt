The plains zebra, a striking animal with bold black and white stripes, is the most common zebra species found in Africa. It's known for its social nature, forming harems led by a single stallion. 

**Biological Name:** *Equus quagga* (formerly *Equus burchellii*)

**Conservation Status:** Near Threatened (IUCN)

**Population Distribution:** Found in fragmented areas across southern and eastern Africa, south of the Sahara. 

**Unique Facts:**
* Each zebra has a unique stripe pattern, making them individually identifiable.
* The stripes are thought to help with camouflage and confuse predators.
* Plains zebras are highly social and form stable harems.

**Habitat:** Treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands, both tropical and temperate. They avoid deserts, dense rainforests, and permanent wetlands.

**Diet:** Primarily grazers, feeding on grasses, especially *Themeda triandra*, *Cynodon dactylon*, *Eragrostis superba*, and *Cenchrus ciliaris*. They also browse on twigs and dig for corms and rhizomes in the dry season. 

**Trivia:**
* The plains zebra is the national animal of Botswana.
* The extinct quagga, once thought to be a separate species, was a subspecies of the plains zebra.
* Zebras have been featured in African art and culture for thousands of years.
* The name "quagga" comes from the Khoikhoi word for zebra and is onomatopoeic for its distinctive call.

**Threats:**
* Hunting for meat and hide.
* Competition with livestock for food.
* Habitat loss due to farming and woody plant encroachment.
* Migration routes blocked by fencing.

**Conservation Efforts:**
* Found in numerous protected areas across its range.
* The Quagga Project aims to recreate the quagga's coat pattern through selective breeding.
